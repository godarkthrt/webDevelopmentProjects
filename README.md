## Introduction to HTML -

- for heading we have html tags from h1 to h6.
- ideally if we use one heading tag in our page then the next subheading in that page should be its child i.e. if we use h1 then subheading should be h2 and not h3 etc..
  - basically the most important thing in the page should be h1, then h2 etc...
- in case we want a data to be separated between multiple paragraphs then it should be done via <p></p> tag as putting spaces between paragaphs in html will not create multiple paras.
- we do not add any data between the tags in void html elements e.g. <hr/>.
  - similarly break element <br/> , it is used to break content into separate lines (while they are still part of same paragraph e.g. poem) in order to have correct meaning.
- tags for unordered and ordered list <ul> or <ol>, themselves do not contain the content but have sub-elements listitems i.e. <li> that contain the actual items of the list.
- <a> tag needs an attribute `href` in order to function correctly like a hyperlink.
- similar to anchor tag <img> tag has a main attribute source or `src` which tells the image element the actual source of the image.
  - we should also always add `alt` attribute to image which means alternate text description that is used by screen reader to describe the image.

- webhosting is the process of making our website available on the internet so that anyone in the world can access it.
  - to do this we need to put all our files and data it consists of (index.html, assets etc..) on to a web server.
  - web server is a server connected to the internet and stuff we put there will be available on the internet ready serve the files to anyone in the world who want to access it.
